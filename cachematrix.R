# Function: makeCacheMatrix
# Description:
#   This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
# Parameters:
#   x, an invertable matrix
# Returns:
#   A special "matrix" that can be used by cacheSolve
#
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


# Function: cacheSolve
# Description:
#   This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
# Parameters:
#   x, a matrix that was created with 'makeCacheMatrix'
# Returns:
#   A matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
#
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {

}
